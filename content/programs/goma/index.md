a stochastic Go engine written in python

This project is a work-in-progress. The API is complete, but none of the logic has been implemented yet.

The [`GTP` (Go Text Protocol)](https://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/) outlines two components: an engine and a controller. This is the engine, for the controller see [dango]({{< ref "dango" >}}).

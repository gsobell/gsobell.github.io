## Ingredients
- 125g Granulated Sugar (⅝ cup)
- Orange zest, from 1 orange
- 90g Vegetable oil (6 tbsp)
- 22ml Water (4½ tsp)
- 2g Baking powder (½ tsp)
- 3g Salt (½ tsp)
- 1 Large egg
- 3ml Almond extract (½ tsp)
- 4ml Vanilla extract (1 tsp)
- 150g All-purpose flour (1¼ Cups)
- 142g Almonds, toasted and ground (1 Cup) 
- 20g Candied orange peel, diced (optional)

### Instructions:
Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F). 
1. In a medium bowl, use your fingers to rub the orange zest into the sugar.
2. Add salt, baking powder, oil, and water, and whisk for one minute.
4. Add egg and extracts, then whisk for another minute.
4. Stir in flour and almonds until almost combined, then stir in the candied citrus peel.
5. Scoop heaping tablespoons of cookie dough onto baking sheets.
For cookies with chewy centers, bake just until the cookies have flattened, about 9 minutes.
Let cool 5 minutes on sheets; transfer to a wire rack, and enjoy!
Let cool completely before storing.

### Substitutions:
- Diced dried apricots can readily replace candied orange peel.

### Story Time
This cookie recipe was almost lost forever!

This recipe is based on [**Almond Cookies**](https://web.archive.org/web/20230131205044/https://www.marthastewart.com/342464/almond-cookies), which began redirecting to [**Perry's Almond Cookies**](https://www.marthastewart.com/1517641/perrys-almond-cookies), a wholly different animal altogether. My wife Pearl thought they were suddenly very different from previous times she made them, and with a little sleuthing, noticed the URL she bookmarked did not match that of the current recipe! 

Enjoy this slightly modified version; the increased zest and candied peel was her addition, elevating these from Almond Cookies to **Orange** Almond Cookies. Pairs excellently with coffee.

These cookies remind me of almond-orange [cantucci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscotti#Cantucci), my favorite.

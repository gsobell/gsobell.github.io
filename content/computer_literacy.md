## Abstract

### What is Computer Literacy?

Computer literacy is not knowing how to find a toggle buried in your phone's overly complicated settings, nor is it how to set up a printer.

- General understanding of major components, their function, and purpose
- Troubleshoot common and minor issues
- Develop a 'common sense'

## Developmental Prerequisites

### Reading
Both being able to recognize keys on keyboard, and read words at a rate that won't cause frustration.

### Mouse
Using a mouse, touchpad, or trackpad requires fine motor skills

### Example Setup
IKEA LÃ„TT table, with a raspberry pi 3/4.
Second hand monitor
Durable and/or cheap keyboard

I would recommend external peripherals that can be replaced when broken, rather needing to trash an entire laptop.
